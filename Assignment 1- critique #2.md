### Objective: Clarity and accuracy 

* Link to article: https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/28/health/cdc-exercise-report-study/index.html

Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

* I would rate this article as a 4 because the data was presented in a cohesive way that made the central message clear, but it could have benefitted if there was more inclusion of charts and bar graphs to show the health statistics. In addition, it could use more creative ways to present the information. For example, changes in font or color would have sufficed. 

What was it?

* The reporter is trying to explain to readers how the vast majority of U.S. adults do not get enough exercise daily. The author uses percentages and statistics in the headline and leads with those facts in the opening sentence to grab the reader's attention right away. 

Was it in the headline?

* Yes, it is included in the headline which helps to emphasize the importance of the situation and shows how there are few adults that get enough exercise. The story leads with these numbers and then goes on to describe the severity of the situation. 

Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent

* Yes, I was able to quickly understand how to navigate the data since it was incorporated within the paragraphs without separate graphs. For this reason, I would rate this article with a 5 because the data was presented clearly and it was easy to understand.

Was that the most efficient way to navigate?

* No, I don't believe that this was the most efficient way to navigate because you have to read closely to find all of the important facts instead of being able to just glance at the article to see them. In addition, some of the numbers were written out and explained through text instead of just being presented in a chart, so the reader must look for the key details in the story and prioritize the facts based on his or her own discretion. 

Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?

* I would improve navigation by adding a chart that shows the percentage of overweight adults in the U.S. I would also include a line chart that would compare or find a correlation between a lack of exercise and health/wellness level. I believe that this would be more effective in persuading the reader that more exercise is needed to improve health in the U.S.

Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate

* I would rate this as a 5. I believe that the data is accurate and very well suported. The author did a thorough job with exploring this topic and researching it. In addition, the author's claims were supported by statistics and studies conducted by the CDC thus, it is accurate information.

List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.

* I do not see any areas where I would question the accuracy of the data because it is all well supported with proper attribution.

List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.

* I would suggest that the reporter check in with the CDC just to verify the studies that are included in this article, but it is a very reliable source so it should not be necessary. 

Did they provide a source?

* Yes, the author received most of the information from the CDC.

Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

* Yes, the author explained all of the numbers well and she did an excellent job of using many statistics to prove her point about unhealthy lifestyles in the U.S. The author wrote very thorough and detailled explanations to accompany the statistics.

### Objective: Quality

Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

* I would rank this article as a 2 because the data was presented in a cohesive and well-organized manner, but more data charts were needed to explain the main points of the article. I believe that this was executed in a poor degree of quality because the data is explained well in writing, but the charts and graph would be more relevant for explaining this information to the readers clearly.

Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.

* The author did well with explaining her critiques of the current status of health amongst adults in the U.S. She provided a very in-depth, well written explanation about health in the U.S. and she included many facts to support her claims, but more graphs and charts would have been very useful to further emphasize the main points of the article. 

Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate) Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?

* This graphic did not accomplish any of those goals because there was ample opportunity to insert graphics such as charts or graphs to explain the information to the reader, but they were not used.

If not, which ones did it not accomplish

* In my opinion, it did not accomplish any of the goals because most of the facts were written out and placed into paragraphs instead of being displayed in a graphic.

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

* The author used the appropriate font and colors for this type of article. However, I believe that by incorporating more styling techniques, this article would have been enhanced. There was only one color used throughout the article and it would have been better to use different styles to display the information. For example, the author could've emphasized key stats about health in the U.S. by blocking out a space for a direct quote or important stat and changing the font color or enlarging it to highlight a piece of information that should be important for the reader to know. Otherwise, it is easy for the reader to just glance over the article or skim through it and miss important information. 

* Type (1-5) I would rate the type with a 1 because it did not present the information in the best format and it could have been improved by incorporating more graphics into the story.

### Objective: Creativity

Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?

* No, the piece did not use creative elements to good effect. The piece lacked good visuals and graphs and instead, lumped all of the statistics together in written form. While the author explained this well, she did not add many visuals which would've been useful to organize the facts and present them clearly to the reader for a better understanding of the article's message. Overall, I believe that the article was highly effective in explaining how the facts about health in the U.S. show that more adults need to exercise regularly, but it would have been even more effective if more graphics were incorporated to tell the story. I would rate the effectiveness as a 3.
