Questions:
* Does the type of flight affect the number of passengers?

Based on the information collected from the dataset, the type of flight does not have any or much affect on the number of 
passengers per flight. Both the commuter and charter flights all have relatively the same number of passengers total. Early
in the dataset, it seemed as if the charter flights carried more passengers, but after the midpoint of the data, more commuter 
flights had larger numbers of passengers. In the end, the numbers were very close thus, the type of flight does not affect the 
number of passengers.

* Does time of day affect the number of passengers on a flight?

Based on the information collected from the database, it appears that flights have a higher number of passengers early in the morning
versus late at night. The data includes passenger numbers for flights that depart/arrive around 8am versus ones around midnight
and the morning flights have an overall higher number of passengers than the late night flights.

* Do domestic or international flights have more passengers compared to one another?

Based on the information collected from the dataset, domestic flights have higher numbers of passengers than international flights. Specifically, domestic flights with scheduled carriers that depart in the morning around 8am have the highest number of passengers.

Steps taken to clean and analyze the data:

* Re-positioned the columns and expanded their widths to fully display all of the relevant information and 
to clearly analyze the data.

* I re-named column B to Period Reported instead of report period because I believe that the new title is easier to understand
and it explains the dataset better. In addition, it's a more inclusive title thatn the previous one.

* I created a filter for column F, Passenger Count. I did this because I used a formula to revise the list so, that it was ordered
numerically starting from the lowest number, 0, to the highest number, 2834451, in the graph. I also needed to reorganize this column to better analyze how the number of passengers does or does not affect other variables in the graph.

* I created a filter for column D, Domestic vs. International flights, because I needed to group the like groups together in order to 
determine if it had any affecton the number of passengers per flight.

Tired of long lines at the aiports in LA? Late-night flights may be your solution

Airline data shows that customers should plan ahead if they're flying out of LA in the morning time. The airports are much busier in the morning around 8am rather than at night because more people opt to fly out earlier. If you want to avoid long lines and heavy traffic, then flying out on late-night flights would be the better option for you. Domestics flights leaving out of LA have the most passengers while late-night flights have much lower numbers of people. Instead of booking early flights, studies show that customers may fare better by choosing to fly out at night to avoid missing your flight or struggling with the hassle of waiting in long check-in and security lines. The next time you're ready to plan your vacation or work trip, think about flying out of LA airports at night where you can avoid busy periods and get some shut eye while flying to your next stop.
