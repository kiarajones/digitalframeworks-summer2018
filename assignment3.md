Steps taken to clean the data:

* Some of the data that required lots of space such as the addresses and phone numbers could not fully be seen due to formatting 
issues, so I increased the widths of each column to make all the data readable.

* The first row and column had a null value in it, so I replaced it with the value N/A to be consitent with the remaining values.

* The telephone numbers were left blank in the original dataset which likely indicated that no number was listed or found for 
that particularstore location. I revised this by placing N/A in the blank columns to represent that no number was found for that location.

* I changed the format of the graph by filtering through the store names and sorting them alphabetically so that the data could be 
analyzed more easily.

* I changed the format of the second column by placing it in order alphabetically because I believe that it will make the data set 
more meaningful to read and analyze.

* I deleted columns H and I with the latitude and longitude because I did not feel that it represented the data set well and 
was extraneous information. In addition, this same information was replicated in the last column, so it was unnecessary to repeat it.
