When it comes to airlines, passengers prefer quality over quantity

By: Kiara Brantley-Jones

Looking to catch a flight somewhere? Your best option may be to choose your flight based on your preference for an airline company by looking at several factors. When purchasing an airline ticket, research shows that passengers prefer to buy tickets from an airline company that they can trust and rely on without being bombarded by expensive unforeseen fees. When choosing to fly with a particular airline, most customers look at the amount of baggage and additional fees charged per trip in the initial price. Every airline has its own unique set of prices and policies for additional fees per customer and this plays a big role for passengers when choosing which airline company they would prefer to fly with for their trip.

Every airline company has its own policies for charging customers various fees ranging from baggage costs to extra charges for booking flights online. The number of fees and the cost of each one is a deciding factor that customers take into consideration when booking flights with different airlines. Customers say that this is an important factor that helps them decide whether to fly with one airline company versus another. One frequent flyer, Trezure James, is a Sophomore college student at Howard University in Washington, DC who travels frequently throughout the school year and she says that extra fees are important when choosing a flight.

“I would rather book a flight with Southwest rather than other airlines like Spirit or Frontier because they have better prices without having to pay all the extra fees for bags, buying tickets online and getting snacks during the flight,” student Trezure James said. “ I fly all the time from school to my hometown and I like flying with Southwest because I don’t have to pay extra for my bags, snacks come with the ticket and I don’t have to worry about being charged with extra surprise fees, I pay for everything upfront”.

Many college students and frequent travelers in general are in the same boat as James, they are looking for a good deal on flights without being burdened by paying unexpected fees that pile on after purchasing the flight ticket. Baggage fees vary across different airline companies, but the sentiment toward them from customers remains consistent; most do not want to pay expensive additional costs beyond the airplane ticket. 

Fare Transparency

When passengers travel, especially on long-distance flights, many of them are stuck with baggage fees because they typically need extra baggage to carry with them to their destination.  Customers say that they expect airline companies to be honest about their additional charges for flights before purchasing the airline ticket. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 61 percent of round trip fares on average in 2018 cost $413. When airlines advertise the cost of a plane ticket and any associated fees that may come along with booking or baggage, this is called fare transparency. This allows customers to know exactly what they are buying when they book a flight.  According to an IdeaWorks report, most passengers will have to check bags or bring carry-ons, for which each airline charges differently.  The higher the fee transparency, the more likely a customer is willing to book a flight with a particular airline company.  Most customers say that they want to know exactly how much they can anticipate paying for amenities, services and baggage fees when purchasing a flight ticket. The unforeseen charges for various services is a red flag that makes them reconsider using the same airline company for future flights. 

What’s really included in the ticket price?

A recent debate has sparked about whether airline companies should inform customers about all fees initially when booking a flight or if they should disclose the additional information after the transaction is finalized. Spirit Airlines receives 47 percent of its profits from additional airline fees while other low cost carriers like Southwest receive 79 percent of its profits from other sources including its frequent-flier program. When customers shop online to book a flight, they are initially presented with a low-ball fare that attracts their attention. Upon clicking on the website to review additional information, the customer is then given the task of digging deeper into the ticket purchase listed on the website to see what the actual purchase amount will be after including flight fees, baggage fees and booking fees. The next step for the customer is to check the price to assess what he or she is actually being charged for when booking the ticket. For example, let’s take a closer look at Spirit Airlines, which is a discount airline that advertises its low costs in flying, but is known for its high additional fees. When a customer purchases a low-ball fare advertised on Spirit Airlines’ website, the amount listed for the initial ticket price is not the only fee that the customer will incur. After choosing the ticket, the customer will have to pay additional fees outlined below.

The standard fee for Spirit Airlines is called the “Bare Fare” rate which includes the following amenities:
* One personal item smaller than 18" x 14" x 8"
* Assigned seating at check-in
* Free boarding pass (when printed at home before arriving to the airport)

Spirit has additional costs that vary based on time of purchase for a basic fare ticket and a difference in route. These extra fees include:
* Carry-On Bags: Starting at $35 
* Checked baggage fee: First checked bag costs $32
* Additional baggage fees for more than one checked bag: $55 to $150 (depending on bag weight)
* Customer-requested seats/ Regular Seats: $1 to $50
* Big Front Seats (Advance purchase): $12 to $150
* Big Front Seats (Purchased on-board/upgrades): $25 to $175
* Change and Cancellation fee: $90 for web modification and cancellation

When comparing these prices to other discount airlines that boast high “fee transparency” by advertising all-inclusive tickets when purchasing flights, Southwest is one of the most popular airlines. It is known for its discount rates without charging customers expensive fees. The airline’s fees are listed below:
* First Carry-On bag: $0
* Checked baggage fees: $0 for first two checked bags 
* 3rd Checked bag or bags exceeding 50 Ibs (but less than 100 lbs) : $75 per bag
* General Seating (no assigned seats): $0
* Preferred Seating: From $30
* Early-Bird Check-In: $15 to $25
* Change and Cancellation Fee: $0

Both discount airlines provide convenience for the customer by offering great last-minute deals however, the hidden costs associated with the ticket purchases serve as a deciding factor for many customers when choosing an airline. For short term travel with few baggage, customers may prefer to fly with airlines such as Spirit, but for customers that want to save on extra flight charges, airlines with all-inclusive prices such as Southwest would likely be the better option. Airline companies may differ in pricing and amenities offered to customers, but the common link between all of them is that they seek high customer satisfaction ratings and hope to provide the best services at affordable prices for passengers on-board.
