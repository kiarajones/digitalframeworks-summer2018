Vermont Democratic Election

I found that in Vermont, the Democratic Party has received its largest contribution amounts from donors registered as either self-employed 
or retired. The largest amounts were $10,000 donations and the majority of them came from people listed under one of those two 
employer statuses.

The most notable story about Vermont's Democratic Party in the past few weeks has been Christine Hallquist who won the Democratic Primary
election in Vermont and is the state's first transgender candidate for governor. This information could be relevant to the story 
because it could further explain the type of people who are donating to the party that supports diversity and inclusion in a bold 
way, which hasn't been done before in previous elections.

In order to find this story, I used the FEC database to collect data. Here are my steps:
* Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2017-2018 election cycle and listed "The Vermont Democratic Party" under recipient name
* Filtered the data for the top donation amount which is $10,000
* Filtered the information further to look for the number of people who donated as self-employed or retired
* Counted the number of donors who fit this profile and compared that number to other employers who also donated $10,000
* Concluded that the mode or most frequent number of top donations ($10,000) came from self-employed and retired donors

Headline: Top Donors help elect the first transgender candidate for governor of Vermont

Nut graf: Vermont is paving the way in this election cycle with the election of the first transgender candidate under the 
Democratic party who will be vying for the Governor's position in the upcoming race. According to the FEC, the top donors for Christine
Hallquist's party are entreprenuers and retirees who dontated top dollars to affect change in the political system. Their support
of Vermont's Democratic Party sets a new trend in politics because it enabled the first transgender candidate to win in the primary race, 
which has never been achieved in past elections.
