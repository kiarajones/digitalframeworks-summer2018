Purchasing a plane ticket has become increasingly expensive and many factors play into buying a ticket at the right time. These factors include different airline companies, timing of purchase based on anticipated arrival date and the distance of the route. I am curious as to why certain airlines charge more than others and how does that connect to a customer's willngness to buy a ticket from one airline company versus another. I plan to compare airline prices and airline companies that have the highest sales or greatest number of purchased tickets per year. I will collect data from the year 2016-2017. 

Here are the features I'll be collecting and why: 
* The number of tickets purchased in 2017 for three major airlines to collect data on how many each company sells. 
* The average prices for flights per month beause I want to calculate how this rises or drops.
* Holiday ticket prices because I want to determine if peak timing affects a person's willingness to buy a ticket.
* The time(s) of year with the most flight ticket purchases because it would possibly explain the reasons why people have a more urgent need for tickets during a particular time frame.
* The destinations that are most frequently visited by customers because this information factors into why people 
purchase tickets in the first place.

I would collect the data by searching the website of individual airlines to see their ticket prices for flights. I would look at their monthly calendars for ticket prices and determine what the average price is. I would also research the number of tickets sold around major holidays and which destinations are most popular by contacting the airline and asking where I can access this data for previous flights by telling them that this is for research purposes. Lastly, I will conduct a search using Pew Research Center's polls to see what time of year most Americans prefer to fly and which airlines they prefer to use.
