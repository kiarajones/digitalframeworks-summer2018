### Final Project Ideas

Idea 1
* I would like to do a comparison between the rate of homelessness in DC and the unemployment rate. 
As of now, I would like to do a general comparison of the overall homeless population without narrowing it down
to one specific group. However, while doing my research if I discover that the data set is too massive then, I will narrow it
down to a smaller group based on age, gender or possibly race.

Idea 2
* I plan to compare airline prices and airline companies that have the highest sales or greatest number of purchased tickets
per year. I will collect data from the year 2016-2017. In order to comprise a dataset for comparison, I will research the 
number of tickets purchased that year for three major airlines and their average prices for flights per month. To narrow down 
the data, I will likely choose a specific route to study and look at ticket sales and purchases.
