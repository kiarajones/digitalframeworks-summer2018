Link to article: https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/us/separated-families-countdown/index.html

Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

I would rate this article as a 5 because the data was presented in a cohesive way that made the central message clear. In addition, the headline was straight forward and the viewer could easily decipher the message immediately. 

What was it?

The reporter is trying to tell readers that the government has not released definitive statistics on the number of immigrants and children that are in custody on the border. He is examining the numbers that have been released thus far and is trting to determine if they are accurate.

Was it in the headline?

Yes, it is included in the headline which helps to make the message even more clear. The story begins with the main point and uses facts, statistics and data throughout the article to prove the author's central point.

Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
Yes, I was able to quickly understand how to navigate the data and use it to understand the main point of the article. For this reason, I would rate this article with a 5 because the data was presented clearly and it was easy to understand.
Was that the most efficient way to navigate?
Yes, this was the most efficient way to navigate because this allowed the reader to scroll through the article and read it for its entirety by carefully placing the data in relevant places throughout the story. If all of the data had been compiled inot one chartor graph placed at the beginning or the end of the story, then the reader would have liklely skipped over it and ignored it to get to the article. This format that the article uses provides the reader with the opportunity to put the data in context based on the story.
Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
I would improve navigation by simply adding a small floating box that moves as you scroll down the page. In that box, the information should include the most important facts about the story or in this case, immigration statistics because it would help the reader understand the numbers easily by seeing the data consistently.

Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
I would rate this as a 4. Due to the nature of this article, the data is not completely accurate and there is room for errror because the main message of thearticle is that the data on immigrants released by the U.S. government may not be acurate since it can't be verified. In adddition, the article mentions that the government released changing numbers therefore, it is unclear whether the information is accurate or not, but this article does a great job of exploring those inaccuracies.
List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
I questioned the accuracy of the data for the sections released by the U.S. government which supposedly lists the numbers related to the current immigration crisis. The author states that those numbers cannot be verified, but she does attempt to examine how to verify those numbers.
List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.
I would suggest that the reporter check in with independent sources or data collection groups- possibly imigration rights groups that have access to the border- and ask them to release numbers that they have compiled based on their research. 
Did they provide a source?
Yes, the author received some information from the Department of Health and Human Services.
Did they explain everything that needed explaining?
Yes, the author explained all of the numbers well and she did an excellent job of comparing statistics to see which ones were accurate and which ones were not. She also explained that some information may not be accurate beforehand.

Objective: Quality

Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.
Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?
If not, which ones did it not accomplish
Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
For example, did it:
Look like it all belonged together?
Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
Type (1-5)
Explain *Color (1-5)
Explain
Objective: Creativity

Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
How?
Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
